14,COMPANY,Amazon,INTRODUCE,CONCEPT,opioid sensors production,"4 Hours Ago | 00:56 President Donald Trump repeated an earlier call for an internet tax, in a thinly veiled shot at Amazon 's Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. ""The internet — they're going to have to start paying sales tax because it's very unfair what's happening to our retailers all over the country that are put out of business,"" Trump said Wednesday. Trump also reiterated concerns about Amazon's effect on the U.S. Postal Service as it struggles to keep up with online orders. The comments mirror tweets from the president in December that named the e-commerce giant. Dec tweet ""There's always been a fear for players like an Amazon or a Google that something like this could actually get through,"" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, told CNBC. ""We believe it's more noise than a real threat."" show chapters 11:21 AM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 | 02:48 There's been speculation that the president's shots at Amazon are aimed at Bezos , whose newspaper has published stories critical of the president. Amazon already collects sales tax on products it sells directly to consumers, but has faced challenges from states over its policy of allowing third-party vendors to charge varying levels of sales tax. The issue has garnered more attention as Amazon continues to take a bigger share of overall retail sales. Amazon celebrated its ""biggest holiday"" shopping season at the end of last year. There is an underlying movement among traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to more heavily tax Amazon, Ives said, so the discussion is ""something you have to keep an eye on."" But the likelihood that an internet tax would pass is small, he said. ""Listen they've [Amazon] significantly changed the retail landscape across the world,"" Ives said. ""I think it's more of the same where they're getting in the crosshairs."" Trump spoke before media and members of the administration Wednesday evening during the signing of the Interdict Act, which seeks to reduce drug smuggling through the purchase of opioid sensors. Amazon did not immediately return a CNBC request for comment. —CNBC's Kevin Breuninger and Eugene Kim contributed to this report.

31,GEOPOLITICAL ENTITY,Venezuela,HAS,EVENT,Unrest over food shortages,"SAN CRISTOBAL/BARINAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - Hungry mobs ransacked a food collection center, and a supermarket in Venezuela’s western Andean state of Merida on Thursday and reportedly even slaughtered cattle grazing in a field as unrest over food shortages spread through the country.An opposition lawmaker from Merida, Carlos Paparoni, said four people had died and 10 were injured in the chaos over the last two days, but he did not specify the circumstances.Four years of recession and the world’s highest inflation have plunged millions of Venezuelans into poverty, and President Nicolas Maduro’s authoritarian socialist regime faces mounting unrest.Venezuela’s Information Ministry did not respond to a request for information about the latest disturbances to rock the nation of 30 million people. Looters plundered a truck carrying corn, a food collection center, and a state-run supermarket, according to Paparoni, and a vet who witnessed the mayhem.A video on social media also showed around a dozen men running into a lush pasture, chasing a cow, and then apparently beating it to death.“They’re hunting. The people are hungry!” says the narrator of the video, who filmed the incident from his car. Lawmaker Paparoni said some 300 animals were believed to have been killed. Reuters could not verify the information.Zuley Urdaneta, a 50 year-old vet in Merida, witnessed the looting of a truck along the highway around 2 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. About two hours later, he said some 800 people converged on a food collection center and proceeded to plunder it.“They knocked down the gates and looted flour, rice, cooking oil, cooking gas,” said Urdaneta. “The police and the National Guard tried to control the situation by giving out what was left.”Looting has been increasing in the provinces since Christmas, with food shortages and hyperinflation leaving millions of people hungry, though the capital, Caracas, has so far been largely unaffected.The opposition says Maduro’s failed economic policies and rampant corruption are to blame for the meltdown in the once booming country home to the world’s largest crude reserves.“What we’re living is barbaric,” said opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido in a tweet referencing the slaughter the cattle. “The dehumanizing regime of Nicolas Maduro is turning a blind eye to the tragedy that we Venezuelans are living.”Maduro’s government accuses political opponents and business-friendly foreign powers of trying to foment a social uprising against him by stoking inflation and hoarding food.In what they said was an attempt to combat “speculation,” authorities last week forced over 200 supermarkets to slash prices, creating chaos as desperate Venezuelans leapt at the chance to buy cheaper food.Some supermarkets were sold out of fruit and vegetables, and staff were unsure if the shelves would be replenished.Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Simon Cameron-MooreOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

Looters plundered a truck carrying corn, a food collection center, and a state-run supermarket, according to Paparoni, and a vet who witnessed the mayhem.A video on social media also showed around a dozen men running into a lush pasture, chasing a cow, and then apparently beating it to death.“They’re hunting. The people are hungry!” says the narrator of the video, who filmed the incident from his car. Lawmaker Paparoni said some 300 animals were believed to have been killed. Reuters could not verify the information.Zuley Urdaneta, a 50 year-old vet in Merida, witnessed the looting of a truck along the highway around 2 p.m. on Thursday afternoon. About two hours later, he said some 800 people converged on a food collection center and proceeded to plunder it.“They knocked down the gates and looted flour, rice, cooking oil, cooking gas,” said Urdaneta. “The police and the National Guard tried to control the situation by giving out what was left.”Looting has been increasing in the provinces since Christmas, with food shortages and hyperinflation leaving millions of people hungry, though the capital, Caracas, has so far been largely unaffected.The opposition says Maduro’s failed economic policies and rampant corruption are to blame for the meltdown in the once booming country home to the world’s largest crude reserves.“What we’re living is barbaric,” said opposition lawmaker Juan Guaido in a tweet referencing the slaughter the cattle. “The dehumanizing regime of Nicolas Maduro is turning a blind eye to the tragedy that we Venezuelans are living.”Maduro’s government accuses political opponents and business-friendly foreign powers of trying to foment a social uprising against him by stoking inflation and hoarding food.In what they said was an attempt to combat “speculation,” authorities last week forced over 200 supermarkets to slash prices, creating chaos as desperate Venezuelans leapt at the chance to buy cheaper food.Some supermarkets were sold out of fruit and vegetables, and staff were unsure if the shelves would be replenished.Writing by Alexandra Ulmer; Editing by Simon Cameron-MooreOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.

14,,,[''],[''],[''],"4 Hours Ago | 00:56 President Donald Trump repeated an earlier call for an internet tax, in a thinly veiled shot at Amazon 's Jeff Bezos, who owns The Washington Post. ""The internet — they're going to have to start paying sales tax because it's very unfair what's happening to our retailers all over the country that are put out of business,"" Trump said Wednesday. Trump also reiterated concerns about Amazon's effect on the U.S. Postal Service as it struggles to keep up with online orders. The comments mirror tweets from the president in December that named the e-commerce giant. Dec tweet ""There's always been a fear for players like an Amazon or a Google that something like this could actually get through,"" Daniel Ives, head of technology research at GBH Insights, told CNBC. ""We believe it's more noise than a real threat."" show chapters 11:21 AM ET Fri, 29 Dec 2017 | 02:48 There's been speculation that the president's shots at Amazon are aimed at Bezos , whose newspaper has published stories critical of the president. Amazon already collects sales tax on products it sells directly to consumers, but has faced challenges from states over its policy of allowing third-party vendors to charge varying levels of sales tax. The issue has garnered more attention as Amazon continues to take a bigger share of overall retail sales. Amazon celebrated its ""biggest holiday"" shopping season at the end of last year. There is an underlying movement among traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to more heavily tax Amazon, Ives said, so the discussion is ""something you have to keep an eye on."" But the likelihood that an internet tax would pass is small, he said. ""Listen they've [Amazon] significantly changed the retail landscape across the world,"" Ives said. ""I think it's more of the same where they're getting in the crosshairs."" Trump spoke before media and members of the administration Wednesday evening during the signing of the Interdict Act, which seeks to reduce drug smuggling through the purchase of opioid sensors. Amazon did not immediately return a CNBC request for comment. —CNBC's Kevin Breuninger and Eugene Kim contributed to this report.
